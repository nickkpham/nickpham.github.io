<h2>Projects</h2>

<div class="project">
  <h3>Audio Frequency Band Detector</h3>
  <p>
    Designed and built an analog circuit that classifies audio signals into
    low, mid, and high frequency ranges. Audio input from a microphone was filtered
    and processed to activate LEDs corresponding to bass, midrange, or treble frequencies.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project involved filter design, signal conditioning, and hands-on testing
    with real audio sources.
  </p>
  <p><b>Skills:</b> Analog electronics, filters, signal processing, hardware debugging</p>
</div>
  
<div class="project">
  <h3>C/C++ Programming Projects</h3>
  <p>
    Developed multiple C and C++ programs focusing on low-level logic, control flow,
    and correctness. Emphasized clean program structure, debugging, and handling edge cases. Final project was creating chess.
  </p>
  <p><b>Skills:</b> C, C++, debugging, data structures, algorithmic thinking</p>

<div class="project">
  <h3>Digital 4-Digit Keypad</h3>
  <p>
  Built and tested a digital keypad system on a series of breadboards.
    Implemented logic to detect and decode key presses while debugging
    signal integrity and wiring issues. 
  </p>
  <p><b>Skills:</b> Digital logic, breadboarding, debugging, hardware interfacing</p>
